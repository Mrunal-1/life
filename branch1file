I don't think you will
ever fully understand
how you've touched my life
and made me who I am.

I don't think you could ever know
just how truly special you are,
that even on the darkest nights
you are my brightest star.

I don't think you will ever fully comprehend
how you've made my dreams come true
or how you've opened my heart
to love and the wonders it can do.

You've allowed me to experience
something very hard to find:
unconditional love that exists
in my body, soul, and mind.

I don't think you could ever feel
all the love I have to give,
and I'm sure you'll never realize
you've been my will to live.

You are an amazing person,
and without you I don't know where I'd be.
Having you in my life
completes and fulfills every part of me.
